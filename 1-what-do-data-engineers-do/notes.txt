Assignment-1:

This all notes to enable Data Analytics I have gathered from this link (https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/n-job-reponsibilities-of-a-data-engineer/)

Enable Data Analytics

1)- I will always look forward for Data strategy for the company
          - Asking stakeholder what are their requirements to showcase them the result via Data
          - Appraoach down stream (Data Analyst) to gather what exactly he wants to achieve for company, and how often require Data          
          - Will approach Up-stream people like (Software Developer) team to understand the structure and how they have design the Database

2)- Serve Data to end-users
          - In the form of Dashboards/ visualization (with different tools as required (PowerBI, tableau, or custom dashboards))
          - Permission of Data for different users
          - Data dump for clients
          - Data endpoints (API)

3)- Schedule, execute, and monitor data pipelines
          - make sure they run without any issue, and monitor them
          - Run schedules, when needed in form of event(trigger) and in response of something
          - Able to scale data pipelines
          - Check data failures, deadlocks, and long runing tasks via data pipelines

4)- Manage Datwarehousing
          - Warehousing performance
          - Data quality common models like (Kimbal modelling)
          - Data modelling

5)- Move data between systems
          - using some tools to move data between system
            (As we know that sometime data needs to exeute on real-time for which we can use spark, pandas, Dockers, and etc)
